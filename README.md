## pyutils

This repository is a collection of generally useful, but unrelated, utility scripts written in Python. Each tool is designed to solve a specific problem or automate a common task. Kinda expanded into shell scripts, but that's fine too.

Python utilities in this repo use [Typer](https://typer.dev/) to provide a modern and user-friendly command-line interface (CLI).

### Utilities
- `json_to_csv.py`: convert JSON file to CSV
- `keygen.py`: used to create key pairs, primarily for Snowflake key authentication
- `jupyterlab_setup.sh`: shell script to install homebrew and uv, create a venv, and install JupyterLab
- `png_icon_generator.py`: generate PNG icon sets from a square image at multiple sizes
- `gpx_concat.py`: concatenates GPX files together
